# Building the Plugin

## Prerequisites
* Protocol Buffers library from Google
* QtCore from Qt 5

## Linux and BSD
At a terminal command prompt, run

    $ qmake
    $ make

in the top-level directory to build the plugin. This will produce
the plugin executable (`protoc-gen-doc`). There's no install step,
just copy the executable to where you want it.

## Windows
Start a Qt/MSVC command prompt, load `vcvarsall.bat` and then run

    > set PROTOBUF_PREFIX=/path/to/protobuf-2.6.1
    > qmake
    > nmake

in the top-level directory to build the plugin. This will produce
the plugin executable (`release\protoc-gen-doc.exe`). You can
create a standalone ZIP distribution with `nmake zip`. MSVC is
currently the only supported compiler on Windows. Building with
MinGW should work, but the `zip` target is not available. I'll try
to fix this in the future.

## Mac OS X
At a Terminal prompt, run

    $ export PROTOBUF_PREFIX=/path/to/protobuf-2.6.1
    $ qmake
    $ make

in the top-level directory to build the plugin. This will produce
the plugin executable (`protoc-gen-doc`). There's no install step,
just copy the executable to where you want it.

Note that on Mac OS X, the protobuf library should be build with
with clang (`CC=clang` and `CXX=clang++`), or you'll get linker
errors.
